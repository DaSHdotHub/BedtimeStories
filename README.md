# Bedtime Stories

The Bedtime Stories website is a page for parents and children alike.
As long as someone can read he or she should be encouraged to visit to check for new or
old, rather classic short stories.

One of the key concepts of this website should be to sample some of these short
stories we all so cherish and love from our childhood. Create an immersion which
goes beyond plain black text on white background.
