# Bedtime Stories

The Bedtime Stories website is a page for parents and children alike.
As long as someone can read he or she should be encouraged to visit to check for new or
old, rather classic short stories.

One of the key concepts of this website should be to sample some of these short
stories we all so cherish and love from our childhood. Create an immersion which
goes beyond plain black text on white background.

## Motivation

```text
One of the thing I do most on a regulary basis is reading a good night story to my son.
As marvelous as books are, sometimes there is no possibilty to bring them along on a
longer roadtrip.

Steps are as follows:

3. Once the master branch has been selected, the page provided the link to the deployed website.
