            <h2>Puss in Boots</h2>
            <br>
            <br>In a land where tales unfold,
            <br>A cat in boots, brave and bold,
            <br>His cunning plan, masterfully told,
            <br>Turned his master's life to gold.
            <br>
            <br>With a sly smile and a clever scheme,
            <br>Puss defeated ogre's dream.
            <br>In a castle, as if by a beam,
            <br>He wove reality from seam.
            <br>
            <br>The king, impressed by such feat,
            <br>Marquis of Carabas he did greet.
            <br>Puss's tricks were quite neat,
            <br>In a dance of deception sweet.
            <br>
            <br>Thus, the cat with wit so grand,
            <br>Earned his master vast land.
            <br>In the end, they took a stand,
            <br>Side by side, hand in hand.
            <br>
            <br>From humble beginnings to royal halls,
            <br>Puss in boots, he enthralls.
            <br>Through each challenge and brawl,
            <br>His courage never falls.
            <br>
            <br>So ends the tale of a cat so clever,
            <br>His legend lives on forever.
            <br>In the hearts of those who endeavor,
            <br>Puss's spirit fades never.

          <h2>Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs</h2>
          <br>
          <br>In a forest deep and wide,
          <br>Seven dwarfs did there abide,
          <br>With hearts as pure as morning tide,
          <br>A princess came to hide.
          <br>
          <br>Mirror's truth, a queen did fear,
          <br>Snow White's beauty, crystal clear.
          <br>Beneath the moon's soft, silvery sphere,
          <br>In slumber, she lay near.
          <br>
          <br>An apple red, with poison laced,
          <br>In dreams, a single kiss was placed,
          <br>A prince's love, not a moment's waste,
          <br>Woke her with gentle grace.
          <br>
          <br>Through trials dark, and friendship rare,
          <br>Their story sings through the forest air,
          <br>A tale of love, beyond compare,
          <br>In hearts forever fair.
          <br>
          <br>Through woods they roam, a joyous band,
          <br>Hand in hand, through enchanted land,
          <br>In the cottage small, by friendship grand,
          <br>Together they make their stand.
          <br>
          <br>In the end, the queen's defeat,
          <br>Revealed by truth, no more deceit.
          <br>In a kingdom where hearts entreat,
          <br>Love and kindness meet.
          <br>
          <br>So ends the tale of Snow White fair,
          <br>With love and joy beyond compare.
          <br>In every heart, a song to share,
          <br>Of a princess, kind and rare.

          <h2>Hansel and Gretel</h2>
          <br>
          <br>In a forest deep, where shadows creep,
          <br>Hansel and Gretel, lost, began to weep.
          <br>Their stepmother's plan, so harsh and steep,
          <br>Left them alone, in woods so bleak and deep.
          <br>
          <br>With pebbles white, Hansel's clever trail,
          <br>Hoping to escape, not to fail.
          <br>But as night fell, their faces pale,
          <br>In the dark woods, their hopes frail.
          <br>
          <br>Then, a house of candy, a sugary sight,
          <br>Windows of sugar, a delight.
          <br>But inside, a witch, her heart not right,
          <br>Planned a feast in the moon's pale light.
          <br>
          <br>Hansel trapped in a cage so tight,
          <br>Gretel feared through the dark night.
          <br>But with her wit and all her might,
          <br>She planned their escape, away from fright.
          <br>
          <br>Outwitting the witch, with a trick so bold,
          <br>Pushing her into the oven's hold.
          <br>Free at last, brave and bold,
          <br>They ran from the house, no longer controlled.
          <br>
          <br>Back through the woods, the siblings raced,
          <br>To their father's arms, they embraced.
          <br>With the wicked stepmother now displaced,
          <br>In their humble home, love they faced.
          <br>
          <br>Their days were filled with joy anew,
          <br>Under skies so wide and blue.
          <br>In every heart, hope grew,
          <br>As Hansel and Gretel's story flew.
          <br>
          <br>A tale of courage, strong and true,
          <br>Proving what love and bravery can do.
          <br>In the darkest times, they made it through,
          <br>Together, their bond forever grew.
