          <br>
          <br>Once Upon A Time
          <br>
          <br>In a land where tales unfold,
          <br>A cat in boots, brave and bold,
          <br>His cunning plan, masterfully told,
          <br>Turned his master's life to gold.
          <br>
          <br>With a sly smile and a clever scheme,
          <br>Puss defeated ogre's dream.
          <br>In a castle, as if by a beam,
          <br>He wove reality from seam.
          <br>
          <br>The king, impressed by such feat,
          <br>Marquis of Carabas he did greet.
          <br>Puss's tricks were quite neat,
          <br>In a dance of deception sweet.
          <br>
          <br>Thus, the cat with wit so grand,
          <br>Earned his master vast land.
          <br>In the end, they took a stand,
          <br>Side by side, hand in hand.
          <br>
          <br>From humble beginnings to royal halls,
          <br>Puss in boots, he enthralls.
          <br>Through each challenge and brawl,
          <br>His courage never falls.
          <br>
          <br>So ends the tale of a cat so clever,
          <br>His legend lives on forever.
          <br>In the hearts of those who endeavor,
          <br>Puss's spirit fades never.

          <br>
          <br>Once Upon A Time
          <br>
          <br>In a forest deep and wide,
          <br>Seven dwarfs did there abide,
          <br>With hearts as pure as morning tide,
          <br>A princess came to hide.
          <br>
          <br>Mirror's truth, a queen did fear,
          <br>Snow White's beauty, crystal clear.
          <br>Beneath the moon's soft, silvery sphere,
          <br>In slumber, she lay near.
          <br>
          <br>An apple red, with poison laced,
          <br>In dreams, a single kiss was placed,
          <br>A prince's love, not a moment's waste,
          <br>Woke her with gentle grace.
          <br>
          <br>Through trials dark, and friendship rare,
          <br>Their story sings through the forest air,
          <br>A tale of love, beyond compare,
          <br>In hearts forever fair.
          <br>
          <br>Through woods they roam, a joyous band,
          <br>Hand in hand, through enchanted land,
          <br>In the cottage small, by friendship grand,
          <br>Together they make their stand.
          <br>
          <br>In the end, the queen's defeat,
          <br>Revealed by truth, no more deceit.
          <br>In a kingdom where hearts entreat,
          <br>Love and kindness meet.
          <br>
          <br>So ends the tale of Snow White fair,
          <br>With love and joy beyond compare.
          <br>In every heart, a song to share,
          <br>Of a princess, kind and rare.

          <br>Once Upon A Time
          <br>
          <br>In a forest deep, where shadows creep,
          <br>Hansel and Gretel, lost, began to weep.
          <br>Their stepmother's plan, so harsh and steep,
          <br>Left them alone, in woods so bleak and deep.
          <br>
          <br>With pebbles white, Hansel's clever trail,
          <br>Hoping to escape, not to fail.
          <br>But as night fell, their faces pale,
          <br>In the dark woods, their hopes frail.
          <br>
          <br>Then, a house of candy, a sugary sight,
          <br>Windows of sugar, a delight.
          <br>But inside, a witch, her heart not right,
          <br>Planned a feast in the moon's pale light.
          <br>
          <br>Hansel trapped in a cage so tight,
          <br>Gretel feared through the dark night.
          <br>But with her wit and all her might,
          <br>She planned their escape, away from fright.
          <br>
          <br>Outwitting the witch, with a trick so bold,
          <br>Pushing her into the oven's hold.
          <br>Free at last, brave and bold,
          <br>They ran from the house, no longer controlled.
          <br>
          <br>Back through the woods, the siblings raced,
          <br>To their father's arms, they embraced.
          <br>With the wicked stepmother now displaced,
          <br>In their humble home, love they faced.
          <br>
          <br>Their days were filled with joy anew,
          <br>Under skies so wide and blue.
          <br>In every heart, hope grew,
          <br>As Hansel and Gretel's story flew.
          <br>
          <br>A tale of courage, strong and true,
          <br>Proving what love and bravery can do.
          <br>In the darkest times, they made it through,
          <br>Together, their bond forever grew.

          <h2>Rumpelstiltskin</h2>
          <br>
          <br>Once Upon A Time
          <br>
          <br>In a kingdom, far and wide,
          <br>Lived a miller, full of pride.
          <br>To the king, he made a claim,
          <br>His daughter could spin straw to fame.
          <br>
          <br>Into gold, she'd spin the hay,
          <br>So the king, without delay,
          <br>Took the girl to a room so vast,
          <br>Full of straw, from first to last.
          <br>
          <br>"Spin this straw to golden thread,
          <br>Or by morning, you'll be dead."
          <br>The king declared with a stern voice,
          <br>Leaving her with no other choice.
          <br>
          <br>In despair, she wept alone,
          <br>Till a strange man, to her shown.
          <br>"Little maiden, do not cry,
          <br>I can help you, if you try.
          <br>
          <br>Spin this straw to gold, I can,
          <br>But you must give me what you can."
          <br>"A necklace," she said with hope anew,
          <br>And he spun gold, as if on cue.
          <br>
          <br>When the king saw the golden room,
          <br>His greed demanded even more bloom.
          <br>To a bigger room, the girl was led,
          <br>With more straw, and growing dread.
          <br>
          <br>Again, the strange man came at night,
          <br>Turning straw to gold, so bright.
          <br>This time, for a ring so fine,
          <br>Her last treasure, but she didn't pine.
          <br>
          <br>The third night, in the largest hall,
          <br>The king's greed surpassed it all.
          <br>"Spin all this, and you shall be,
          <br>The queen, married to me."
          <br>
          <br>But the girl had nothing left to trade,
          <br>When the strange man, once more, her aide.
          <br>"This time, your first child you'll give to me,
          <br>Once you're queen, happy and free."
          <br>
          <br>Desperate, she agreed to his plan,
          <br>And he spun gold, as only he can.
          <br>The king, amazed by the golden sight,
          <br>Married the girl, as he promised that night.
          <br>
          <br>Years passed, and a child was born,
          <br>But the queen's heart was heavy and torn.
          <br>The strange man returned, for his due,
          <br>But the queen begged, "What can I do?"
          <br>
          <br>"I'll give you gold, lands, or wealth,"
          <br>But he shook his head with stealth.
          <br>"Unless you guess my name, right and true,
          <br>Your child, I will take from you."
          <br>
          <br>Three days she had, to guess his name,
          <br>Or lose her child to the man, strange and lame.
          <br>In despair, she sent messengers wide,
          <br>To find names, far and side.
          <br>
          <br>On the third day, one came back,
          <br>With a story, not a knack.
          <br>"In the woods, I saw a man,
          <br>Dancing, singing, 'Rumpelstiltskin's my name.'"
          <br>
          <br>That night, when he came to claim,
          <br>The queen smiled, knowing his game.
          <br>"Is your name Harry, or perhaps John?"
          <br>He smirked, for he thought he had won.
          <br>
          <br>Then she said, with a voice so still,
          <br>"Is your name perhaps Rumpelstiltskin?"
          <br>Angry and red, he stomped his feet,
          <br>And disappeared in a fiery defeat.
          <br>
          <br>The queen hugged her child, so dear,
          <br>Relieved, with no more fear.
          <br>In her kingdom, she ruled with grace,
          <br>And peace and joy filled the place.
          <br>
          <br>And thus, the tale of Rumpelstiltskin ends,
          <br>A story of twists and bends.
          <br>A tale of deceit, courage, and fate,
          <br>In this magical, fairy tale state.
